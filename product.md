A primer for engineers on how to evaluate a product roadmap, including nine big areas that need to be tackled:

- Does it connect to a higher-level vision/strategy?
- Is it clearly explained, easy to understand?
- Is it outcome oriented? Does it provide value to customers?
- Is it flexible? Can it be iterated?
- Are its initiatives scoped and prioritised based on evidence?
- Does it identify risks?
- Is it aggressive but achievable?
- Does it take on appropriate risk?
- Is it easy to reference? Is it a living document?
